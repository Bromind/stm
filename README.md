STM

This project is an homework for R. Guerraoui course. Then it is not allowed for other student to look at this code before the deadline. Copying this project before the deadline would be against EPFL laws about exams, and federal and international laws on copying.

After the deadline (something around 13 jan. 2016) and for other people, copying is allowed under the terms of the WTFPL.

I don't like to avoid people to look at other's code, but EPFL are above these feelings.
